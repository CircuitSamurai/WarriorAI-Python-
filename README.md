⚔️ DataSamurai: Mastering the Art of Python & Data ⚔️

Welcome to my personal dojo of Python programming and data mastery. This is where I train, sharpen my skills, and challenge myself through a series of projects and exercises using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Each script is a swing of the sword, every bug a worthy opponent, and every visualization a demonstration of precision. The path is long, but every line of code written is a mark of discipline and progress.

This repository serves as my training ground, a place to practice the fundamentals of Python and data manipulation—arrays, data frames, loops, functions, and plotting. Here, I refine my techniques, starting with small drills and building up to complete projects that test my logic, patience, and problem-solving. Like a samurai returning to the dojo each day, I revisit old code, improve it, and learn from my past battles.


🏯 Structure of the Dojo

python_refresher/ – The Dojo Foundation
Revisit the fundamentals of Python: variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and basic I/O. Every drill strengthens your coding stance and prepares you for advanced battles with data.

numpy/ – The Blade of Numbers
Fundamental drills with arrays, matrix operations, linear algebra, and vectorized computations. Every operation is a precision strike.

pandas/ – The Scrolls of Data
Data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory analysis. Each dataset is a battlefield, and every insight gained is a victory.

matplotlib/ – The Brush of the Sensei
Visualizations that capture patterns and trends. Line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and multi-plot grids teach me how to convey meaning with clarity.

fastapi/ – The Gateway of the Samurai
Building APIs with speed and precision. FastAPI allows the samurai to expose their data creations to the outside world—turning logic into services, models into endpoints, and insights into interactive experiences. Here I train to wield async operations, dependency injections, and powerful documentation tools like OpenAPI and Swagger UI.
