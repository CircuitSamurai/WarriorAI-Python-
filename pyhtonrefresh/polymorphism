"""
Polymorphism - Greek word that means "many forms".
         TWO WAYS TO ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM IN PYTHON:
1. Duck Typing - Object must have necessary attributes/methods
2. Inheritance - An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class.

"""
Another way to achieve polymorphism besides inheritance
Object must have the minimum necessary attributes/methods
"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck"
