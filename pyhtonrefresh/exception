"""
Exception - An event that interrupts the normal flow of a program.
Common built-in exceptions include:
    - ZeroDivisionError → occurs when dividing by zero
    - TypeError → occurs when an operation is applied to the wrong data type
    - ValueError → occurs when a value is of the correct type but invalid

Exception handling keywords:
    1. try     → code that might cause an error
    2. except  → code that runs if an error occurs
    3. finally → code that runs no matter what (error or not)

try:
    # Ask the user for input and attempt to convert it to an integer
    # This line may raise a ValueError if the input is not a number
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    
    # Attempt to divide 1 by the user-entered number
    # This line may raise a ZeroDivisionError if number == 0
    print(1 / number)

except ZeroDivisionError:
    # This block runs ONLY if division by zero occurs
    print("You can't divide by zero!")

except ValueError:
    # This block runs if the input cannot be converted to an integer
    print("Enter only numbers please!")

except Exception:
    # This is a catch-all block for any other unexpected exceptions
    # It should usually be placed LAST
    print("Something went wrong!")

finally:
    # This block always executes, whether an exception occurred or not
    # Commonly used for cleanup actions (closing files, releasing resources)
    print("Do some cleanup here")
