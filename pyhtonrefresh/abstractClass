"""
Abstractg class: A class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed.
They can contain abstract methods, which are declared but have no implementation
Abstract classes benefits:
1. Prevents instantiation of the base class
2. Requires children to use inherited abstract methods
